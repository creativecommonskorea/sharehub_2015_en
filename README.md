# Wordpress for english.sharehub.kr 2015

## Changes

* WordPress is now handled by composer. composer.json contains the
  exact version of WP we're using.

See http://getcomposer.org/ for installation details.

* Some times `composer update` will not give any results, in which case `computer remove wordpress && composer require wordpress` will fix the problem.
